# Intro to Charming Masterclass charm

This is a demo charm developed for a Canonical Masterclass in January 2024. It deploys `nginx` on machine substrates. The operation capability is basically nihil.

☢⚠ **This is not a production charm!** ⚠☢

## Repository instructions

The repository contains 4 branches:

- `part-1-basic-setup`
- `part-2-integrations`
- `part-3-observability`

Each branch corresponds to a hour-long masterclass section and is designed so that, if you're lagging behind a section and the masterclass is moving on to the next, you can check out the corresponding branch and not be left behind.

Each branch/sections covers a selection of core charming topics.
